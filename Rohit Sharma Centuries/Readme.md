🏏 Rohit Sharma Centuries Analysis and Prediction (Power BI + Python)
📊 Project Overview
This project involves an end-to-end data analysis and prediction pipeline focused on Indian cricketer Rohit Sharma's international centuries. The dataset includes the number of centuries scored by Rohit Sharma up to November 2023. I performed exploratory data analysis, built visualizations using Power BI, and utilized Python to analyze trends and predict the number of centuries Rohit Sharma might score up to the year 2027.

🗂 Dataset Description
Name: rohit_sharma_centuries.csv

Source: Manually compiled from publicly available cricket records

Data till: November 2023

Fields:

Year

Number_of_Centuries

⚠️ Note: This dataset only includes the year-wise count of centuries Rohit Sharma has scored across all international formats (Tests, ODIs, T20Is) up to Nov 2023.

🛠 Tools Used
Power BI: For creating an interactive dashboard to visualize trends in Rohit Sharma's century-scoring pattern.

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn/Statsmodels):

Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis

Time series or regression-based prediction of future centuries

Jupyter Notebook: For performing the Python analysis and prediction.

📈 Project Workflow
Data Collection & Cleaning

Gathered and formatted century data till Nov 2023

Removed missing/incomplete entries

Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

Year-wise trend analysis

Identified peak years and average frequency

Dashboarding (Power BI)

Created a visually interactive dashboard showing:

Annual century count

Moving averages

Format-based contribution (if available)

Prediction (Python)

Modeled trends using linear regression / time series forecasting

Predicted the total number of centuries Rohit Sharma might score up to 2027

🔮 Prediction Summary
Based on current trends and assuming similar performance, Rohit Sharma is projected to score X additional centuries by 2027. (Replace 'X' with your model output)
